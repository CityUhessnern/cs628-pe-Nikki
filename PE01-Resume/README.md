# Input
There is no user input in this application. However, the resume text is 
rendered in HTML and then accessed by the main application.

# Process
The application imports the HTML and CSS for the Resume and then renders 
them. The CSS uses margins and font size to change how some sections are 
rendered.

# Output
The output is a simple text resume website that is lime green, is centered 
overall, but different types of text have different margins. There is also 
one section that has larger font than the rest of them.
