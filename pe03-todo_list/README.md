# Input
This program accepts text input in an input box, and click input on the "Add" button and the "Delete" buttons that are paired with each task.
# Process
Clicking the Add button creates a change event that uses a function to add the contents of the input bar into a task list array. The Delete button uses a filter function to stop rendering the task that was deleted. 
# Output
The task list array is rendered as boxes with the task label in the center and a red delete button on the right side. The title is rendered at the top, with the input box and Add button underneath, and then all of the tasks, each in their own task cards.
